PvNP Research: using graph theory
Last Modified: 28 August 2019

Description:
  Trying to use graph theory, in particular edge covering, to show that P vs NP is either possible or inpossible. 
  I created my own algorithm to try and show I can find the edge cover for any graph in polynomial time. If this is
  possible then P would be equal to NP! I have been working with my Professor for revisions and testing, Dr. Joseph
  Anderson.
  
Current Position:
  At the moment I have a algorithm that solves 90% of graphs in Polynomial time. I have found one graph that breaks
  the code (shown in file "test2"). I am working on revising the code to find a solution for this type of graph.
